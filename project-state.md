# Project State

Last updated: 2026-05-31

## Current Objective

Address M1-001 by validating CSV parser edge cases on a main-based feature branch.

## Current Stage

M1-001 implementation and full local validation complete; PR #22 opened from `feature/m1-001-csv-parser-edge-cases` to protected `main`; GitHub `rust` CI passed and review is required.

## Open Risks

- Risk: CSV dialect and units may vary across DAQ exports.
  Owner: Software Architect
- Risk: Filter outputs may be misinterpreted if phase, latency, and sample-rate assumptions are undocumented.
  Owner: Systems Engineer
- Risk: MVP scope could expand into GUI, real-time DAQ, or certification claims.
  Owner: Project Coordinator
- Risk: Approved third-party crates may introduce transitive license or supply-chain risk.
  Owner: Security Engineer

## Pending Decisions

- Decision: Confirm MIT license before external publication.
  Owner: Project Coordinator
  Status: Accepted in `decisions/ADR-002-license-assumption.md`.
- Decision: Select production CSV parsing crate after dependency review.
  Owner: Software Architect / Security Engineer
  Status: Accepted in `docs/dependency-review.md`.
- Decision: Choose report format priority: text-first or JSON-first.
  Owner: Product / Documentation Engineer
  Status: Text and JSON are both implemented for MVP.

## Next Responsible Role

Role: Project Orchestrator

Expected deliverable: Wait for protected-branch review on PR #22.

## Orchestration Status

- Execution tier: Tier 2 MVP.
- Selected workflow: Project orchestration plus open-source library and data-analysis workflows.
- Current milestone: Dependency-reviewed MVP slice complete.
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/kota-wilson/waveform-reconstructor-analyzer`.
- Current milestone: `M1: Validated MVP`.
- Next gate: Required review for PR #22.
- Stop condition: Stop before adding more dependencies or expanding into GUI/DAQ/certification work.

## Granularity Status

- Current expected zoom level: levels 1-3 for architecture, levels 3-5 for first implementation task.
- Required artifacts: project charter, requirements, risk register, traceability matrix, architecture, orchestration plan, repository MVP slice.
- Abstraction review status: Required after architecture plan.

## Environment Status

- Project root: `/Users/kota/Desktop/softwareai/projects/waveform-reconstructor-analyzer`.
- Isolation level: Level 1 Cargo workspace.
- Local environment: Rust/Cargo; no dependencies installed.
- Dependency status: Approved crates added and pinned in `Cargo.lock`; see `docs/dependency-review.md`.

## Traceability Status

- Requirements: `requirements.md`.
- Traceability matrix: `traceability-matrix.md`.
- Verification matrix: `traceability-matrix.md` updated with current MVP evidence.
